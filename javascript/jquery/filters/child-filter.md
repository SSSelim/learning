- They allow you to select elements based on their position inside a parent element


```javascript
ul li:last-child // selects the last child of parent elements
                 // the last li child of each ul element is matched


div p:nth-child(4) // retrieves all p's inside div that are the fourth child of
                   // their parent element
```

# APIs in Clint-side JavaScript

- Client-side JS in particular has many APIs available to it

- These are not part of the JS language itself

- They are built on top of the core JS language

- They generally fall into two categories:

1. Browser APIs

- built into the web browser

- are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment

2. Third party APIs

- are not built into the browser by default

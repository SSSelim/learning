# Javascript Engine

- Javascript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or
  actually on any device where exists a special program called 'the Javascript
  engine.'

- The browser has an embedded engine, sometimes called 'Javascript VM'

- Different engines have different codenames:
  - V8 - in Chrome, Opera
  - Gecko - in Firefox

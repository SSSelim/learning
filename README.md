# Learning 

This repository contains all the notes on various topics that I had interest
in and searched about it over the years.

I like to take notes while learning and searching about a specific topic, also I
do not like to search for the solution of the same problem again.

This repo has all the notes and quick references about them.
They are being extracted from different resources.

I started out as just computer/software related stuff, but now I would like to use this
habit for other areas of searching as well.

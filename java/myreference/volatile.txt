# is used to mark a Java variable as "being stored in main memory".

# is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads.
# guarantees visibility of changes across threads.

## the value of this variable will NEVER BE CACHED THREAD-LOCALLY, 
   all reads and writes will go straight to 'main memory', (not CPU cache)


## an access to a volatile variable NEVER HAS THE POTENTIAL to BLOCK:
   we're only ever doing a simple r/w, so unlike synchronized block
   we will never hold on to any block, because accessing a volatile variable 
   never holds a lock, it is not suitable for cases where we want to read-update-write
   as an atomic operation.

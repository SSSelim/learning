# RACE CONDITIONS

# DEADLOCK

# STATELESS
A worker that doesnot keep state internally
(but re-reads it every time it is needed) is called 'stateless'.

# NON-BLOCKING IO

# Stale Data/State
Stale state is information in an object that does not reflect reality. Invalid data

Example: an object's members are filled with information from a database,
but the underlying data in the database has changed since the object was filled.

Dangerously stale state is stale state that might adversely affect the operation
of a program, i.e. causing it to perform incorrectly due to invalid assumptions about the data's integrity.

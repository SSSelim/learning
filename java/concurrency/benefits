# Better resource utilization
5 seconds reading file A
2 seconds processing file A
5 seconds reading file B
2 seconds processing file B
-----------------------
14 seconds total

!! CPU is idle during IO, so we can take advantage of that !!

5 seconds reading file A
5 seconds reading file B + 2 seconds processing file A
2 seconds processing file B

# Simpler program design in some situations
Handling each file in its own thread is easier to do it in order. During IO
other threads can use the cpu time.

# More responsive programs
A server can listen for incoming request, if it was singlethread, it had to wait
until request is processed. However, if the processing is done on another thread
server can be responsive and keep listening for incoming requests.

# More complex design
Hard to detect problems, dealing with shared resources.

# Context Switching Overhead
CPU has to save the current threads properties before taking another thread.
The switch, load and save cause some performance overhead. Is NOT cheap.

# Increased Resource Consumption
Each thread has its own local stack in the memory, also take up some resources
inside the operating system. More threads more resource consumption

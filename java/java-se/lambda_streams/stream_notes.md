# Stream Notes


## The Life of a Stream

- Born(at a spliterator: both splitable and iterable)
- Transformed(by an intermediate operation)
- Collected(by a terminal operation)

## Terminal Operations 

- Search operations(findFirst, findAny, anyMatch, allMatch)
- Side-effecting operations(forEach, forEachOrdered)
- Reductions


Accumalators are implicitly sequential.

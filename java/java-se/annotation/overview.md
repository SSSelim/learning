# Annotation Overview

- a form of metadata
- provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself
- have no direct effect on the operation of the code they operate

```java
@Author(name = "Selim", date = "01/01/1001")
```

- 'name', 'date' are elements

- if there is just one element named value, then the name can be omitted
- @SuppressWarnings(value = "unchecked")
- @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")

- if annotation has no elements, then the parentheses can be omitted
- @Override

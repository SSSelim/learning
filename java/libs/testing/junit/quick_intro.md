# JUnit 

- Tests are code, treat them like it.
- Test classes should end with Test. (StringHelperTest.java)
- Each method in test class should public, void, no-arg.
- Annotate methods with @Test

- Reading a file from the test is not recommended as I/O operations are
  unpredictable and slow. Use mocks.

# Code Quality

- Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like
  trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often.

- Manual testing can identify software bugs but cannot improve the quality of
  the system.

- Static code quality analysis exposes quality issues in the code and provides
  suggestions for improvement.

- Static code anaylsis is the process of anaylsing code without executing it.

- Code review is also a sort of static code anaylsis but is performed with humans.

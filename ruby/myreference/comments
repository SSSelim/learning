# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

How do I comment out multiple lines?
Put a # in front of each one.

Why does the # in puts "Hi # there." not get ignored?
The # in that code is inside a string, so it will be put into the string until the ending " character is hit.
These pound characters are just considered characters and aren't considered comments.

Helpful for putting large amounts of text without worrying about escape sequences or string evaluation.
“Here documents” begin with <<-.
These are followed immediately by an identifier or string that specifies the ending delimiter.
(No space is allowed, to prevent ambiguity with the left-shift operator.)
The text of the string literal begins on the next line and continues 
until the text of the delimiter appears on a line by itself.

document = <<-HERE         # We begin with <<- followed by the ending delimiter HERE
This is a string literal.
It has two lines and abruptly ends with a newline...
HERE

poem = <<END 
\tThe lovely world
with logic so firmly planted
cannot discern \n the needs of love
nor comprehend passion from intuition
and requires an explanation
\n\t\twhere there is none.
END

That is called a "heredoc" or "here document".
It is used to create a multi-line string, and you use it by starting with << and an all caps word, in this case END.
Ruby then reads everything into a string until it sees another END.
You can use any word, not just END, so if your string has the word "END" in it,
you would use something different like <<BIGDOC and end with BIGDOC.
The last thing is the string includes all the indentation.

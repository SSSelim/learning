Everything in Ruby, including strings and even nil, is an object.

Itâ€™s easier to describe what objects do, which is respond to messages.
An object like a string, for example, can respond to the message length,
which returns the number of characters in the string:

Typically, the messages that get passed to objects are methods,
which are functions defined on those objects.

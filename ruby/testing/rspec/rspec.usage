By convention, tests written with RSpec are called "specs" (short for "specifications")
and are stored in the project's 'spec' directory. 

With RSpec, we are always describing the behavior of classes, modules and their methods.
The 'describe' block is always used at the top to put specs in a context.
It can accept either a class name, in which case the class needs to exis, or any string.

describe StringCalculator do
end

By convention, class methods are prefixed with a dot(".add"), 
and instance methods with a dash ("#add").

describe ".add" do
end

We are using a context block to describe the context, 
is technically the same as 'describe', but is used in different places,
to aid reading of the code.

context "given an empty string" do
end

'it' block to describe a specific 'example', which is RSpecs way to say "test case".
Generally, every example should be descriptive, and together with the contxt should form an understandable sentence.

To run the specs:
$ bundle exec rspec


To run rspec for documentation format
bundle exec rspec --format documentation

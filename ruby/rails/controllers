# A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application.
  Routing decides which controller receives which requests.
  Often, there is more than one route to each controller,
  and different routes can be served by different actions.
  Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.


$ rails generate controller welcome index     # controller named welcome, with an action named index

!! A frequent practice is to place the standard CRUD actions in each controller in the following order:
  index, show, new, edit, create, update and destroy.
  You may use any order you choose,
  but keep in mind that these are public methods;
  they must be placed before any private or protected method in the controller in order to work.

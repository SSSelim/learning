# rails generate model creates a database migration file inside the db/migrate directory.
  Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables.
  Rails uses rake commands to run migrations,
  and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been applied to your database.
  Migration filenames include a timestamp to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.

$ rails generate model Article title:string text:text

$ rake db:migrate


!!Because you're working in the development environment by default, this
  command will apply to the database defined in the development section of your
  config/database.yml file. If you would like to execute migrations in another
  environment, for instance in production, you must explicitly pass it when
  invoking the command: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production.

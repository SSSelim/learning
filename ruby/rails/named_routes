root             'static_pages#home'
get 'help'    => 'static_pages#help'
get 'about'   => 'static_pages#about'
get 'contact' => 'static_pages#contact'


help_path -> '/help'
help_url  -> 'http://www.example.com/help'

the common convention of using the _path form except when doing redirects,
where weâ€™ll use the _url form. 
(This is because the HTTP standard technically requires a full URL after redirects,
though in most browsers it will work either way.)

GET                     # used for reading data on the web; it just means “get a page”,
                          and every time you visit a site like http://www.google.com/
                          or http://www.wikipedia.org/ your browser is submitting a GET request

POST                    # it is the request sent by your browser when you submit a form.
                          In Rails applications, POST requests are typically used for creating things 
                          (although HTTP also allows POST to perform updates).

PATCH 

DELETE


PATCH and DELETE, are designed for updating and destroying things on the remote server.
These requests are less common than GET and POST since browsers are incapable of sending them natively,
but some web frameworks (including Ruby on Rails) have clever ways of making it seem like browsers are issuing such requests.
As a result, Rails supports all four of the request types GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE.


the Static Pages controller does not use the standard REST actions.
This is normal for a collection of static pages:
the REST architecture isn’t the best solution to every problem.

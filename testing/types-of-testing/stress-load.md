# stress-load testing

- how well will the application perform when many people are using it at once?

- usually, you implement this with software like JMeter

- these tests usually don't verify the validity of responses, which is why we have the other tests

- the stress test environment should be as close as possible to the production
  environment; if not, the results won't be useful

- individual unit tests are essential to quality control, but what happens when
  different units of work are combined into a workflow?

- just as more traffic collisions occur at intersections, the points where
  objects interact are major contributors of bugs

- "what we usually call and 'integration test' because it is testing how our code
  works with a third-party library(Swing)" -- from Growing OO

# Scala Language

- An OO language, also supports aspects of FP
- 2003, Martin Odersky
- Statically typed, compiled,
- Unlike Java it performs a large amount of type inference(feel like a dynamic language)
- Match expressions, and associated concepts like patterns and case classes
- Scala's concurrency is based on messages and actors, rather than on the locks
  of old-school Java code

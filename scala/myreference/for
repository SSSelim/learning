- arg is implicitly val, not a var. 

- yes, its value is changing for each iteration, but a new val is created each time.

- to is a method take one integer, when a method takes one parameter,
  we can call it without dot or parentheses.
  0 to 2 = 0.to(2)
  1 +  2 = 1.+(2)

  for (i <- 0 to 2) {
    println(array(i))  
  }

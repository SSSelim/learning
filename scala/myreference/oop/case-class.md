# Scala Case Classes

- Can be thought of as similar to OO extensions of the concept of enums
- Parameterized enums
- A form of value type
- Case classes are standard classes with a special modifier: case

- case classes can extend other classes, including trait and case classes
- why not make all classes case classes if they too awesome?
- case classes cannot be subclassed

- One of the most common reason for creating case classes is the
  pattern-matching feature that comes free with case clases

*NOTE:* Setter and getter, toString, equals, hashCode can be generated by IDE.
However, in case of any change in class, those methods have to be regenerated.
But this is not an issue in case classes.

## Provided Conveniences

- paramaters are prefixed with val, provides accessors

- natural implementations of methods toString, hashCode, equals

- a copy() method for making modified copies, a better alternatives to setter
- use named arguments to modified parameters u want
- obj.copy(age = 18) // other parameters are copied as it is

- a factory method with the name of the class: apply()
- an unapply method to be used as an extractor for pattern matching

- default implementation for serialization

- tupled method: case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
- val me = ("selim", 25); Person.tupled(me)

- curried method
```scala
val p = Person.curried
val pWithName = p("selim")
val pWithNameAndWithAge = p(25)
val person = p("selim")(25)
```

- case modifier signals the compiler to assume certain things about 
  the class and to define certain boilerplate based on those assumptions.
- Default case classes methods can be overridden

```scala
case class TemperatureAlarm(temp : Double)

// creating case class object without new keyword
// like enum
// under the hood there is a factory method creating object
// apply method is being used when called without new
// TemperatureAlarm.apply(99.9)
val alarm = TemperatureAlarm(99.9)
```


```java
// equivalent java class
public class TemperatureAlarm {
  private final double temp;

  // (temp) constructor
  // getTemp()
  // toString()
  // hashCode()
  // equals(Object)
}
```

## Case Class with Pattern Matching


```scala
case class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String)

val p = Person("John", "Doe")

p match {
  case Person(first, last) => println("Full name: " + first + " " + last)
}
```

- apply and unapply methods

```scala
def apply(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
  new Person(firstName, lastName)
}

def unapply(p: Person): Option[(String, String)] =
  Some((p.firstName, p.lastName))
```

- Another useful container object, like lists, tuples are also immutable.

- Difference from the List is that they can contain different types of elements.

- They are useful when u want to return multiple object from a method.

-!Tuples are one based

> val pair = (99, "Balls")
> println(pair._1)
> println(pair._2)

- Accessing tuples is different than Lists, cus list apply method returns the same
  type. But tuples has to return different types for different elements in it.

- Tuples are 1 based cus of a tradition set by other languages. Haskell and ML.

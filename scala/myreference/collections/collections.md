# Scala Collections

- Scala collections are usually immutable
- Scala decomposes the many aspects of a List-like collection into separate concepts
- Scala builds up the core of its List from very small number of concepts.
- Scala's approach to collections is to provide a consistent experience across
  different types of collections

- Scala encourages developers to build their own collections that feel like the
  built-in collection classes

- Scala has both immutable and mutable version of its collections
- Immutable versions are default(and always available to every Scala source
  file)

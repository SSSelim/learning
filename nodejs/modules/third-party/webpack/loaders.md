# Webpack Loaders

- A loader is a function that handles the transformations

- Webpack has a huge number of loaders that fall into a few categories

- The most common use case for loaders is transpilling from one dialect to another

- ES6 and React code is transpiled by including the 'babel-loader'

- We specify the types of files that Babel should be run on, then webpack takes
  care of the rest

- Another popular category of loaders is for styling

# Babel

- There is no need to compile JS

- However, not all browsers support the latest ES6 to ES7 syntax

- The conversion is called transpiling, and it is what Babel is designed to do

- The first version of the project was called 6to5 (in Sep 2014)

- Renamed to Babel in Feb 2015

- Babel is used in production at FB, Netflix, Paypal, Airbnb and more

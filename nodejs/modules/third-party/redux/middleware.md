# Middleware

- Middleware serves as the glue between two different layers or different pieces
  of software

- Redux also has middleware. It acts on the store's dispatch pipeline

- It consists of a series of function that are executed in a row in the process
  of dispatching an action

- HOF allow you to insert functionality before or after actions are dispatched
  and state is updated

- Each middleware function is executed sequentially

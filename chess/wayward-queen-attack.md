# wayward queen attack

- it is an aggressive opening (breaks the fundamental rule)

- it is not recommended in tournament play, can be used for fun


### opening


- white: e4 - Qh5
- black: e5 - Nc6

- when you are defending you are supposed to defend the attacked piece, not attack the attacker

- focus on the defending the middle pawn(e5)

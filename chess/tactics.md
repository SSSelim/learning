# tactics

1. double attack

- one piece attacks two enemy pieces at the same time

2. fork

- is a double attack by either the knight or the pawn

3. pin

- piece either cannot move or does not wish to move for fear of losing a more valuable piece

- *absolute pin:* when a piece is pinned to the king, it is absolutely illegal for that piece to move
  - black king - black knight - white rook
  - black king - black rook - white bishop

- *relative pin:* legal to move the piece, but results in losing higher value piece
  - black queen - black knight - white bishop

4. skewer (opposite of pin)

- attack more valuable piece, when it gets out of the way, take the less valuable piece

- long range pieces are capable of doing this: bishop, rook, queen

5. discovered attack / check

- black king - white bishop - white rook

- move the bishop to attack another piece, while rook says check

# chess principles

- knights before bishops

- do not attack until the opening is done

- move your rook to open file(file without pawns)

- move queen to one line up in order to connect the rooks

- do not move your pieces later than 5th row if you donot have a good reason for that
  - opponent's pawn will attack them

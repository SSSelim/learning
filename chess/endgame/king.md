# understanding king

- opening and middlegame is a dangerous time for king

- castle as quickly as possible (gets it out of the center and active the Rooks)

- the endgame poses very different problems and needs than the other phases

- in the endgame, pawns and kings take on enornous significane.

- since threat to king are no longer real, both players should rush their king
  to the center of the board as quickly as possible

> when an endgame occurs, rush your king to the center of the board

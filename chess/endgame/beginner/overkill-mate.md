# overkill mates

- one side has an enourmous amount of material vs the lone enemy king

- two win an overkill endgame, you only need to learn two techniques:

1. staircase
2. box

### staircase

- Q + Q vs K
- Q + R vs K
- R + R vs K

- be careful with the rook as the enemy king can approach and attack them unlike queens

### box

- to goal is to imprison the enemy in an ever-shrinking box

- Q
- R

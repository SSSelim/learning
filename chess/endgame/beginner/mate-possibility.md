# what can or cannot mate vs lone king


### can

- 1 queen
- 2 rooks
- 1 rook
- 2 bishops (two complex)
- 1 bishop and 1 knight (might never occur in your career)

### cannot

- 1 pawn (no promotion)
- 1 bishop
- 1 knight
- 2 knights (avoid a1, a8, h1, h8 squares and draw the game)

#### bishop vs queen

- same as just mating with queen, stay away from bishop squares
- check to catch bishop
- bishop mostly helps the opponent not to have stalemate :)

#### knight vs queen

- same as just queen
- be careful with the nasty forking possibilities

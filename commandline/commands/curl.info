transfer a URL

cURL is a tool for working with URLs.
cURL lets us query a URL from the command line.
It lets us post form data, FTP to a server, and much, much more.
One of the places that cURL comes in handy most often is working with APIs.
With cURL we can try out new APIs simply, with just the command line,
with no need for installing, or writing complex wrappers around the API.

curl www.google.com # http request and prints its response

curl -i www.google.com # print with header info

curl -I www.google.com # print just the header info 

curl -L www.google.com # Follow redirects. If a page is moved(302) follow the link

curl -O http://www.selimssevgi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/learning-english-wordle-300x130.png # download file

curl -o my_image.png <img URL> # rename the file

curl -X POST <url> # default is get request method. to use a different one like PATCH,PUT,DELETE

curl -X POST <url/echo?fname=Mark&lname=Bates> # sending parameters

curl -X POST -d "fname=Mark&lname=Bates" <url> # passing data in a request body

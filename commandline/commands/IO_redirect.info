# ls 
-- put output on standart out

# ls > my.files
-- prints nothing, cus is redirected to my.files.

# ls somenonexistingfile
ls : somenonexistingfile : No such file or directory

# ls somenonexistingfile > save.out
ls : somenonexistingfile : No such file or directory
  
!! Still prints something. Cus we redirect standart out, but it uses standart err

# ls somenonexistingfile 2> save.err

The use of the number 2 comes from an implementation detail: All the I/O descriptors for
a UNIX process were kept in an array. The first three elements of the array, numbered 0, 1,
and 2, were defined to be the standard in, out, and err, in that order. Thus in the shell you can
also redirect standard out by using “1>” as well as the shorter “>”.

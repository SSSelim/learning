search sub-strings in files

grep is found on almost all Unix/Linux systems,
whereas ack or ag may need to be installed.

ack or ag both sport more modern APIs than grep.
Both are faster than grep; ag is significantly faster.

grep <searchterm> <filetosearchin>

grep Pack README.md # search for Pack in README file

grep "r..y" README.md # search for words starts with r, anny two characters, ends with y

grep -c ruby README.md # counting occurences. output : number 

grep -n Ruby README.md # displaying the line numbers of the results

grep -i rails README.md # ignore-case

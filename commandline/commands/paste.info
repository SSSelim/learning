paste <filename> # acts like cat command

paste -s <filename> # joins all the lines in the file. Default delimitir is tab.

paste -d, -s <filename> # joins all the lines using the comma delimiter.

paste - - < <filename> # one - reads one line. two -- reads two lines and pastes them side by side

paste - - - < <filename> # three lines into one line

paste -d ':,' - - - < <filename> # three lines two different delimeters for three columns

!! -d option can take more than one delimiters. 

paste <filename> <filename> # paste the content of the two files side by side

paste -d, <filename> <filename>

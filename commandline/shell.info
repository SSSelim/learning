sh or Bourne Shell: the original shell still used on UNIX systems and in UNIX-related environments.
                    This is the basic shell, a small program with few features.
                    While this is not the standard shell, it is still available on every Linux system for compatibility with UNIX programs.
                    
bash or Bourne Again shell: the standard GNU shell, intuitive and flexible.
                            On Linux, bash is the standard shell for common users.
                            This shell is a so-called superset of the Bourne shell, 

csh or C shell: the syntax of this shell resembles that of the C programming language.
                Sometimes asked for by programmers.

tcsh or TENEX C shell: a superset of the common C shell, enhancing user-friendliness and speed.
                       That is why some also call it the Turbo C shell.

ksh or the Korn shell: sometimes appreciated by people with a UNIX background.
                       A superset of the Bourne shell; with standard configuration a nightmare for beginning users.
                       

$ cat /etc/shell # gives an overview of known shells

$ echo $SHELL # current shell

$ cat /etc/passwd # default shell

# tcsh # type name of the shell to switch 

!! executing of a normal program !! 
When such a program is executed, a new process is created because Bash makes an exact copy of itself.
This child process has the same environment as its parent, only the process ID number is different. This procedure is called forking.

!! shell built-in commands !! 
Built-in commands are contained within the shell itself. When the name of a built-in command is used as the
first word of a simple command, the shell executes the command directly, without creating a new process.

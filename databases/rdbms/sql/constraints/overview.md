# Constraints

- A constraint is a restriction on what you can insert into a column

- Constraints are added when we create a table

- Some of the constraints:
  - NOT NULL,
  - PRIMARY KEY
  - FOREIGN KEY
  - UNIQUE
  - CHECK

* CHECK constraints and views (security) both help maintain control when you
  have multiple users.

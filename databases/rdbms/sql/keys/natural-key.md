# Natural Key

- Is a key with business meaning: an attribute or combination of attributes that
  is unique by virtue of its business semantics

- Examples of natural keys are the US SSNumber, Australian Tax File Number

- If a candidate key attribute has meaning outside the DB context, it's a
  natural key, regardless if whether it's automatically generated.

- Experience has shown that natural PKs usually cause problems

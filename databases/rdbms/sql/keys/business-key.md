# Business Key

- If your user is looking at a list of items on screen, how do they
  differentiate between items A, B, and C?

- The same property, or combination of properties, is your business key

- The business key is what the user thinks of as uniquely identifying a
  particular record, whereas the surrogate key is what the application and db
  systems rely on

- The business key property or properties are most likely constrained UNIQUE in
  your database schema

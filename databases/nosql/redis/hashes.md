# Hashes

- Hashes in Redis allow you to store groups of key-value pairs in a single
  higher-level Redis key.

- Functionally, the values offer some of the same features as values in Strings
  and can be useful to group related data together.

- Data grouping can be thought of as being similar to a row in a relational
  database or a document in a document store.

- Similar to java hashMap

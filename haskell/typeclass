# if a type is a parf of a typeclass, that means that it supports and implements
  the behavior the typeclass describes.

  and returns a Bool. the type of those two values must be a member of the Eq class. 

# Eq is used for types that support equality testing. == and /=

# Ord is for types that have an ordering.

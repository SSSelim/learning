# [1..20] -- a list containing number from 1 to 20

# ['a'..'z']

# ['K'..'Z']

# ranges are cool cus you can also specify a step.

# [2,4..20] -- given first two elements

# [3,6..20] -- given first two elements

# !!! [stepsize,start..end] is not like this !!!

# [20..1] -- doesnt work

# [20,19..1]

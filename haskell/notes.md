# Haskel Quick Notes

- Haskell is a purely functional, lazy, statically typed programming language.

- Purely functional:
  - Functions are values
  - Values never change

- A common pattern in Haskell is that making basic functions that are obviously
  correct and then combining them into more complex functions.

- You do computations in Haskell by declaring what something is instead of
  declaring how you get it.

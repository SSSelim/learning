# power of habits by charles duhigg

- why we do what we do in life and business

> there is nothing you can't do if you get the habits right

## part one - the habits of individuals

### ch01 - the habit loop - how habits work

- how could someone find a jar of nut when he couldnt say where the kitchen was located?

- how could someone find his way home when he had no idea which house was his?

- habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort

- habit: three step process

1. there is a "cue", a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use

2. there is the "routine", which can be physical or mental or emotional

3. there is a "reward", which helps your brain figure out if this particular
   loop is worth remembering for the future


- habits aren't destiny. they can be ignored, changed, or replaced

- when a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making
- it stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks

- habits never really dissapear

- the problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between bad and good habits

- if we learn to create new neurological routines that overpower those
  behaviors, if we take control of the habit loop, we can force those bad
  tendencies into the background


- without habit loops, our brains woould shut down, overwhelmed by the minutiae of daily life

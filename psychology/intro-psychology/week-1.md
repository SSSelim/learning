# week-1: psychology emerges from the shadow of the soul

- we have all other sciences to understand the pychical world

- people thinks of them as special, spiratuel creatures

- now we have a science just for that: psychology

- it starts with Rene Descartes

- he saw a moving statue in a park(hydrolics just being used)

- even though it was a pychical thing, it moved like it has an intention

- Rene observed that the animal are same like that statue

- but human being are being a little different: dualism

- human body could be like a machine, and it is also has a soul

- cartesian dualism by Descartes (not popular today)

* frog leg

- when leg was with the frog, it had soul?
- now leg is cut it, staying there by itself
- give some electrical current, the leg moves
- body works a like mechanical device, like the statue in the park?

* but humans?

- patients understand the language, but cannot form sentences
- died, brain out, tumor on the specific part of the brain for all patient

- another part of the brain for a problem of vice versa

- different part of the brain is responsible for different jobs, mechanic?

- can we build something mechanical, and give that electricity, so it will behave like human?

- if assumed, human behavior must reflect natural laws, and back to scientific studies
- we can study human behavior scientifically because it is determined by natural laws

### before freud

 - psychology was born in germany, late 1800s
 - economically strongest

 - neoral transmition speed, 1000 people from right hand to left hand, measureable

 - how much extra sound/metarial adding people will feel the different? (weber fractions)
    - just noticeable difference (JND)

 - wilhelm wundt (1832 - 1920), first psychologist

 - Charles Darwin: why the features are the way they are?
 - what is the function?

 - william james: what is memory, attention, reflection, for?

 - philosopher(generated ideas), psychologist

## lecture 5: truth seeking

1. the rationalists: knowing by thinking: you can understand a phenomenon and
   construct accurate theories simply by thinking about a topic correctly
  - descartes, spinoza, leibniz

2. the empiricists: knowing by the senses: (thinking and arguing is not enough)
  - locke, berkeley, hume

- we need experiments to check if our thinking is correct

- psychology is a science, we drive truths by experimentation

* seeking questions
  - observational research (a person's behavior will change when they are being observed)
  - correlational research

* seeking answers
  - experiments and contrasts

## lecture 6: knowledge association

- eating a lot of cheeseburgers will save you from dying by cancer

- becuase eating lots of them will cause to have a heart attack before you have cancer

- marshmallow experiment

- positive correlation: height and perceived attracthedness (at age of 18 for girls)
  - when one get increase, the other one increase, or vice versa

- negative correlation: height and perceived attracthedness (at age of 13 for girls)

- strength(weak, strong) of the relation is based on its absolute value in the scale(1, -1)

- taller people earn more money
  - interviewing people were biased for tall people?
  - third variable?
  - rich people have food for having highest potential for getting taller
  - rich people have rich connection

- this kind of researchs suggests a truth, any very often that truth should not
  be trusted on the basis correlation alone

**NOTE:** the golden rule of correlation is this: causation always implies
correlation, but correlation does not imply causation.

## lecture 7: knowledge by association

- manipulate one(independent) variable, and observe the change on the other variable(dependent)

- good science:
  - is either interesting or relevant (marketing)
  - is replicable
  - is generalizable

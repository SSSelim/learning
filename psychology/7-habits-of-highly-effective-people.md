# 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

## Part One: Paradigms and Principles

```shell
we began to realize that what we were doing to help our son was not in harmony
with the way we really saw him. When we honestly examined our deepest feelings,
we realized that our perception was that he was basically inadequate, somehow
"behind". No matter how much we worked on our attitude and behavior, our efforts
were ineffective because, despite our actions and our words, what we really
communicated to him was "you are not capable, you have to be protected."
```

* the personality and character ethics

- character ethic as the foundation of success:
  - integrity
  - humility
  - fidelity
  - temperance
  - courage
  - justice
  - patience
  - industry
  - simplicity
  - modesty
  - golden rule

* primary and secondary greatness

- "what you are shouts so loudly in my ears that I cannot hear whay you say"

* the power of a paradigm

- the fundamental problem has nothing to do with your behavior or your attitude.
  It has everything to do with having a wrong map

- each of us has maps whichs can be divided into 2 main categories:
  - maps of the things are, or realities
  - maps of the way things should be, or values

- two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right. it is not
  logical; it is psychological.

* the power of a paradigm shift

- ...almost every significant breakthrough in the field of scientific endeavor
  is first a break with tradition, with old ways of thinking, with old paradigms

- people on train, another man with children, irritating children, can you
  control them? they lost their mother: paradigm shift

- Principles are like lighthouses

* on the maturity continuum:

- *dependence* is the paradigm of you. you take care of me; you come through for
  me, you didnt come through me, I blame you for the results

- *independence* is the paradigm of I. I can do it, I am responsible, I am
  self-reliant, I can choose

- *interdependence* is the paradigm of we. We can do it, we can cooperate, we
  can combine our talents and abilities and create smth greater together

- life is, by nature, highly interdependent. To try to achieve maximum
  effectiveness through independence is like trying to play tennis with a golf
  club, the tool is not suited to the reality


- true effectivesness is a function of two things:

1. what is produced (the golden eggs)
2. the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose)

- if you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the
  goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the
  other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden
  eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose.

- effectiveness lies in the balance: P/PC Balance
  - Production of desired result, the golden eggs
  - Production Capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs

#### organizational PC

- a machine, a responsible person
  - runs the machine in optimal, non-stop, no-maintaince
  - no-cost, high profit
  - gets promoted(golden egg)

- same machine(sick goose), another person gets in charge
  - machine starts to break down
  - high maintaince cost, less profit
  - gets blamed


- the PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to
  treat your best customers

- you can buy a person's hand, but you can't buy his heart. His heart is where
  his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can't buy his
  brain. That's where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness.

>> No one can persuade another to change. Each of us guards a gate of change
>> that can only be opened from the inside. We cannot open the gate of another,
>> either by argument or by emotional appeal.


## Part Two: Private Victory

### Habit 1: be proactive -- principles of personal visio

- because of the unique human capacity of self-awareness, we can examine our
  paradigms to determine whether they are reality, or principle-based or if they
  are function of conditioning and conditions

##### the social mirror

- there are three social maps

1. genetic determinism (inherited)
2. psychic determinism (from childhood/parents)
3. environment determinism(boss, spouse, economy, politics)

- Nazi Captured Frankl. They controlled everything in his environment but not what was on his mind.
- he choose to imagine a future that he would like to have, he at least had that freedom

- between stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose

##### "proactivity" defined

- "response-ability" -- the ability to choose your response

- highly proactive people recognize that responsbility
  - they do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior
  - their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice(base on values),
    rather than a product of their conditions(based on feelings)

- in making such a choice, we become reactive
- reactive people are often affected by their physical environment
  - if the weather is good, they feel good, it affect their performance

- proactive people can carry their own wheather with them

- reactive people are also affected by their social environment (social whether)

- the ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person

##### taking the initiative

- many people wait for something to happen or someone to take care of them

- people who end up with the good jobs are proactive ones who are solutions to
  problems, not problems themselves.


##### act or acted upon

>> what is our response? What are we going to do? How can we exercise initiative
>> in this situation?

##### listening to our language

- reactive language: there is nothing i can do. thats just the way i am. he
  makes me so mad. they wont allow that. i have to do that. i can't. i must.if only

- proactive language: lets look at our alternatives. i can choose a different
  approach. I control my own feelings. I can create an effective presentation. i
  will choose an appropriate response. choose. i prefer. i will. that language
  comes from a basic paradigm of determinism.

- a serios problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling
  prophecy. People become reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined,
  and they produce evidence to support the belief.

- weigh the consequences of each action, compare and choose what you want to do.  You don't "have to" it.

- where do we focus our time or energy?
- Circle of Concern: things which we have no real control
- Circle of Influence: things which we have control over

* alcoholics anonymous prayer:

"Lord, give me the courage to change the things which can and ought to be
changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the
wisdom to know the difference."


### Habit 2: begin with the end in mind

- imagine your own funaral, person from family, from friends, work, community
- what would you like each of these speakers to say about you and your life?

>> if the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just
>> gets us to the wrong place faster

* all things are created twice:
  - there is a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation of all things

- Habit 1 says: "You are the creator."
- Habit 2 is the first creation

- management is a bottom-line focus:
  - *how* can I best accomplish certain things?

- leadership deals with the top line:
  - *what* are the things I want to accomplish?

>> Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things.

- management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership
  determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

- the metamorphosis taking place in most every industry and profession demands
  leadership first and management second.

#### rescriptings: becoming your own first creator

- the two additional unique human endowments that enable us to expand our
  proactivity and to exercise personal leadership in our lives are *imagination* and *conscience*

- self-awareness, imagination, conscience

- conturies have their own written constituion, individuals could have their own

#### alternative centers

* security, guidance, wisdom, and power

- spouse centered
- family centered
- money centered
- work centered
- possesion centered
- pleasure centered
- friend/enemy centered
- church centered
- self centered

* spouse centeredness

- thread is strong emotional dependence, emotional worth
- become vulnerable to anything affecting the spouse
- phantom security when all appears to be going well
- guidance is based on the emotion of the moment
- wisdom and power are lost in the counterdependent negative interactions

* family centeredness

- sense of security or personal worth comes from family tradition/culture/reputation
- guided by the emotions of the moment


* money centeredness

- security comes from the net worth, many factors could affect this net worth
- work and money provide no wisdom, no guidance, only limited degree of power and money

- put aside everything else, economic demands come first
-

>> the work will come again, but childhood won't -- a father rejecting to work on saturday

* work centeredness

- workaholics, work comes before health, relationships and other areas
- work is their identity: i am a doctor, i am a writer, i am an actor
- self-worth is in their work, 
- security is vulnerable of act on their work
- guidance is a function of the demands of the work
- wisdom and power come in the limited areas of their work

* possession centeredness

- possession of metarial, and fame, glory etc
- it can vanish rapidly, influenced by so many forces
- security coming from there will always felt threatened
- feel superior with someone with less of them, or inferior with someone with much of them


* pleasure centeredness

- instant gratification is available and encouraged
- consumes so fast, next level of fun should be bigger and higher
- too many vacations, too many movies, too much tv, too much video, game playing
- where is security, the guidance, the wisdom, and the power?

* friend/enemy centeredness

- acceptance and belonging to a peer group
- making an enemy center of one's life, to the point of an obsession; a colleage, a boss, manager

- allowing one individual and his weaknesses to distort his entire map of life
- effecting one's relationship with other loved ones

- divorced coupled, still psychologically still married
- they each need the weaknesses of the former partner to justify their accusations

- has no intrinsic security
- feelings of self-worth are volatile, a function of emotional state or behavior of other people
- guidance comes from the person's perception of how others will respond
- wisdom is limited by the social lens or by an enemy-centered paranoia

- the individual has no power, other people are pulling the strings

* self centeredness

- if we look closely at many of the popular approaches to growth and
  self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core

- there is little security, guidance, wisdom, or power in the limited center of self

- it accepts but neves gives, becomes stagnant

#### identifying your center

- a center may be limiting your personal effectiveness

- more often than not, a person's center is some combination of these and/or other centers

- depending on time and condition, another center could become the compelling force

- goind from one to another, resulting relativism is like roller coasting through life

- there is no consistent sense of direction, no persistent wisdom, no steady
  power supply or sense of personal, intrinsic worth and identity

- the ideal is to create one clear center from which you consistently derive:
  - a high degree of security
  - guidance, wisdom, power
  - empowering your proactivity
  - giving congruency and harmony to every part of your life

#### a principle center

- our security comes from knowing that correct principles do not change

- we can depend on them, principles don't react to anything

- principles don't die

- they can not be destroyed

- the personal power that comes from Principle-Centered Living is the power of:
  - a self-aware
  - knowledgeable
  - proactive individual
  - unrestricted by
    - the attitudes, behavior, and actions of others
    - many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people

- personal responsibility, or proactivity, is fundamental to the first creation

- habit 1 says "you are the programmer"
- habit 2 says "write the program"

#### visualization and affirmation

- a good affirmation has five basic ingredients:
  - it is personal
  - it is positive
  - it is present tense
  - it is visual
  - it is emotional

- if you visualize the wrong thing, you will produce the wrong thing

- almost all of the world-class athletes and other peak performers are visualizers

- they see it; they feel it; they experience it before they actually do it

>> they begin with the end in mind

- affirmation and visualization are forms of programming

#### identifying roles and goals

- writing is a kind of psycho-neural muscular activity which helps bridge and
  integrate the conscious and subconscious minds

- writing distills, crystallizes, and clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts

- they may get consumed by work and neglect personal health

>> without involvement, there is no commitment

### Habit 3: put first things first -- principles of personal management

>> things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least

1. what one thing could you do(you arent doing now) that if you did on a regular
   basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life?

2. what one thing in your business or professional life would bring similar results?

- habit 1 says, "you are the creator, you are in charge"
  - four unique human endowments:
    1. imagination
    2. conscience
    3. independent will
    4. self-awareness

- habit 2 is the first or mental creation

- habit 3 is the personal fruit, the practical fulfillment of habits 1 and 2

- habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation

- right brain imagines, make plan as a leader, left brain manages/executes the plan

#### the power of independent will

- self-awareness, imagination, conscience, and independent will

- effective management is putting first things first

- leadership decides what "first things" are

>> the successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do

>> they dont like doing them either necessarily, but their disliking is
>> subordinated to the strength of their purpose

- subordination requires a purpose, a mission(habit 2)

- independent will, do something even when you don't want to do it

- be a function of your values rather than a function of the impulse or desire
  of any given moment

#### four generations of time management

- organize and execute around priorities

#### quanrant II

- urgent means it requires immediate attention

- urgent matters are usually visible, insist on action, right in front of, pleasent
- often these urgent things are unimportant

- importance, on the other hand, has to do with results
- if smth is important, it contributes to your mission, your values, your high priority goals

- quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management
- it deals with things that are not urgent, but are important
- all those things we know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren't urgent

#### what it takes to say "no"

- the only place to get time for Q2 in the beginning is from Q3 and Q4

- a Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center

#### the quadrant II tool

- a Quadrant II organizer will need to meet six important criteria:

1. coherance: suggests that there is harmony, unity, and integrity between:
  - your vision and mission
  - your roles and goals
  - your priorities and plans
  - your desires and discipline

2. balance: help you to keep balance between different areas of your life

3. Quadrant II focus: organize your life on a weekly basis

4. A "people" dimension: need a tool that deals with people, not just schedules

5. flexibility: your planning tool should be your servant, never your master

6. portability: should also be portable

#### living it

- habit 1: you are the programmer
- habit 2: write the program
- habit 3: run the program

- "you simply can't think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with
  people and efficiency with things."

#### deletegation: increasing P and PC

- if we delegate to time, we think efficiency
- if we delegate to other people, we think effectiveness

- the key to effective management is delegation

- there are basically two kids of delegation:

1. gofer delegation
  - go for this, go for that
  - do this, do that
  - tell me when it is done

2. stewardship delegation
  - focuses on results instead of methods
  - gives people a choice of method

- trust is the highest form of human motivation
- it brings out the very best in people

## part 3: public victory

- you have to like yourself before you can like others

- if you dont know yourself, if you dont control yourself, if you dont have
  mastery over yourself, it is very hard to like yourself, except in some
  short-term, psych-up, superficial way

### the emotional bank account

- describes the amount of trust that's been built up in a relationship

- it is the feeling of safeness you have with another human being

- if i make deposits into an Emotional Bank Account with you throught
  - courtesy,
  - kindness,
  - honesty,
  - keeping my commitments to you
  - i build up a reserve

- our most constant relationships require our most constant deposits
- with continuing expectations, old deposits evaporate

- your accounts with people you interact with on a regular basis require some constant investment

- building and repairing relationships are long-term investments

### six major deposits

**understanding the individual**

- really seeking to understand another person is probably one of the most
  important deposits you can make, it is the key to every other deposit

- what might be a deposit for you, might not be perceived by someone else as a deposit at all

- one person's mission is another person's minutia

- to make a deposit, what is important to another person must be as important to
  you as the other person is to you.

> "do you like baseball that much?"
> "no, but i like my son that much"

- we project our intentions on the behavior of others

> do unto others as you would have others do unto you

**attending to the little things**

- the little kindnesses and courtesies are so important

- small discourtesies, little unkindnesses, little forms of disrespect make large withdrawals

**keeping commitments**

- keeping a commitment or a promise is a major deposit
- breaking one is a major withdrawal

**clarifying expectations**

- the cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in conflicting or
  ambiguous expectations around roles and goals

**showing personal integrity**

- one of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present

- it is the love and the discipline of the one student, the one child, that
  communicates love for the others

**apologizing sincerely when you make a withdrawal**

> it is the weak who are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong

- sincere apologies make deposits
- repeated apologies interpreted as insincere make withdrawals

**the laws of love and the laws of life**

- unconditional love

> it is more onble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor
> diligently for the salvation of the masses

### habit 4: think win-win -- principles of interpersonal leadership

- trying to get the fruits of cooperation from a paradigm of competition

* six paradigms of human interaction
  - win-lose
  - lose-win
  - lose-lose
  - Win-Win or No deal

#### win-win

- win-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena

- win-win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody

- one person's success is not achieved at the expense of exclusion of the success of others

- not your way or my way; it is a better way, a higher way

#### win-lose

- the paradigm of the race to Bermuda

- if i win, you lose

- value does not lie inside them, it lies outside

- it is in comparison with somebody else or against some expectation

- Competition, not cooperation, lies at the core of the educational process.
  Cooperation, in fact, is usually associated with cheating.

- most results you want depend on cooperation between you and others

- the win-lose mentality is dysfunctional to that cooperation

- "Who's winning in your marriage?" is a ridiculous question. If both people aren't winning, both are losing.

#### lose-win

- "go ahead, have your way with me"
- "step on me again, everyone does"
- "i am a loser, i have always been a loser"

#### lose-lose

- two win-lose people get together

- murder is suicide, that revenge is a two-edged sword

- judge asks husband to sell the assets, and share the half with the wife
  - husband sells the the car, worth of 10,000$, for 50$

- lose-lose is the philosophy of the highly dependent person
  - without inner direction who is miserable and thinks everyone else should be, too

> if nobody ever wins, perhaps being a loser isn't so bad

#### win

- people with win mentaility don't necessarily want someone else to lose
- what matters is that they get what they want

- when there is no sense of contest or competition, win is probably the most
  common approach in every negatiation

#### which option is best?

- if you value a relationship and the issue isn't really that important, you may
  want to go for lose-win in some circumstances to genuinely affirm the other person

- the best choice depends on reality

- win-win is the only real alternative in interdependent realities

#### five dimensions of win-win

1. character
  - integrity
  - maturity
    - ego strength / empathy balance
    - self confidence / respect for others balance
    - the concern for people / concern for tasks balance
    - I am okay, you are okay
  - abundance mentality
    - inner sense of personal worth and security
    - scarcity mentality (zero-sum game, if you win, i lose)
      - it almost smth is taken from them when someelse succeeds
      - "they are always comparing, always competing"

2. relationships
  - we're focused on the issues, not on personalities or positions

3. agreements

- "the program primarily focused on people achieving self-selected performance
  objectives and on groups achieving team objectives"

### habit 5: seek first to understand, then to be understood

- principles of empathic communication

- communication is the most important skill in life

#### empathic listening

1. ignoring listening (not listening at all)
2. pretending listening
3. selective listening (hearing only certain parts)
4. attentive listening (paying attention and focusing energy on the words)
5. empathic listening (not the technique of "active" or "reflective" listenings)

- empathy is not sympathy
- sympathy is a form of agreement, a form of judgment

- the essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone
- it is that you fully, deeply understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually


- satisfied needs do not motivate. It is only the unsatisfied need that motivates

#### diagnose before you prescribe

#### four autobiographical responses

- we evaluate -- we either agree or disagree

- we probe -- we ask questions from our own frame of reference

- we advise -- we give counsel based on our own experience

- we interpret -- we try to figure people out


* the skills, the tip of the iceberg of empathic listening, involve four developmental stages

1. mimic content (skill taught in "active" or "reflective" listening)
  - repeat what you other person says
  - no brain used
  - at least no "evaluating, proving, advising, interpreting"

2. rephrase the content
  - left/logical brain used

3. reflect feeling
  - right brain

4. includes both the second and the third
  - rephrase the content and reflect the feeling


- ethos, pathos, and logos
  - ethos: personal credibility, the faith people have in your integrity and competency
  - pathos: empathic side, the feeling, you are in alighment with the emotional trust of another person's communication
  - logos: logic, the reasoning part of the presentation

### habit 6: synergize, principles of creative cooperation

- synergy means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

- one plus one equals three

- the essense of synergy is to value differences, to respect them, to build on
  strengths, to compensate for weaknesses

- "We obviously value the physical differences between men and women, husbands
  and wives. But what about the social, mental, and emotional differences?"

#### fishing for the A Third Alternative

- Buddhism calls this "the middle way"

- middle in this sense does not mean compromise; it means higher

#### negative synergy

- "the very strength of the relationship is in having another point of view"

- sameness is uncreative, and boring

- the essense of synergy is to value the differences

#### valuing the differences

- the key to valuing those differences is to realize that all people see the
  world, not as it is, but as they are.

#### force field analysis

- describes any current level of performance or being as a state of equilibrium
  between the driving forces that encourage upward movement and the restraining
  forces that discourage it


## part four -- renewal

### habit 7: sharpen the saw - principles of balanced self-renewal

- habit 7 is personal PC

- it is renewing the four dimensions of your nature:
  1. physical - tone - a good animal
  2. spiritual - perspective - a saint
  3. mental - autonomy - a good craftsman
  4. social/emotional - connectedness - a good friend

- taking time to sharpen the saw is a definite Quadrant II nature

#### the physical dimension (habit1: proactive)

- eating right kinds of foods
- getting sufficient rest and relaxation
- exercising on a regular basis

- if practive, physical dimension stay in quadrant II
- if not practive, physical dimension goes to quadrant I

- heartbeat, flexibility, strength

#### the spritual dimension (habit 2: principle-centered)

- quadrant-II

- medidation

- music

- "the doctor told him to spend the following day in the place where he was happiest as a child."

- "i have so much to do today, I'll need to spend another hour on my knees" - Marting Luther
  - so we could get more power to do all

#### the mental dimension (habit 3)

- education

- reading good literature (quadrant-II)
  - "the person who doesn't read is no better off than the person who can't read"

- "the Great Book", "the Harvard Classics", "autobiographies"

- writing, journal of our thoughts, experiences, insights, and learnings

#### the social/emotional dimension (habit 4, 5, 6)

- let's at least agree to communicate until we can find a solution we both feel good about(habit 4)

- let me understand you first (habit 5)

- let see if I understand you

- now let me explain myself

- let's find the third way (habit 6)

- "service is the rent we pay for the privilege of living on this earth"

#### balance in renewal

- organizational as well as individual effectiveness requires development and
  renewal of all four dimensions in a wise and balanced way

#### synergy in renewal

- the more proactive you are (habit1), the more effectively you can exercise
  personal leadership(habit2), and management (habit3) in your life

- the more effectively you manage your life(habit3), the more quadrant-II
  renewing activities you can do (habit7)

- the more you seek first to understand (habit5), the more effectively you can
  go for synergetic win-win solutions(habit4-6).

- the more you improve in any of the habits that lead to independence(habits
  1,2,3), the more effective you will be in interdependent situations (habits 4,5,6)


- "That's true financial independence. It's not having wealth; it's having the
  power to produce wealth. It's intrinsic."

#### The Upward Spiral

- our conscience

- education of the conscience is vital to the truly proactive, highly effective person

- ""That which we persist in doing becomes easier -- not that the nature of the
  task has changed, but our ability to do has increased.""

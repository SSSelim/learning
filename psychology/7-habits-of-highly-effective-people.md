# # 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

* on the maturity continuum:

- *dependence* is the paradigm of you. you take care of me; you come through for
  me, you didnt come through me, I blame you for the results

- *independence* is the paradigm of I. I can do it, I am responsible, I am
  self-reliant, I can choose

- *interdependence* is the paradigm of we. We can od it, we can cooperate, we
  can combine our talents and abilities and create smth greater together

- life is, by nature, highly interdependent. To try to achieve maximum
  effectiveness through independence is like trying to play tennis with a golf
  club, the tool is not suited to the reality


- true effectivesness is a function of two things:

1. what is produced (the golden eggs)
2. the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose)

- if you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the
  goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the
  other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden
  eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose.

- effectiveness lies in the balance: P/PC Balance
  - Production of desired result, the golden eggs
  - Production Capability, the abiity or asset that produces the golden eggs

#### organizational PC

- a machine, a responsible person
  - runs the machine in optimal, non-stop, no-maintaince
  - no-cost, high profit
  - gets promoted(golden egg)

- same machine(sick goose), another person gets in charge
  - machine starts to break down
  - high maintaince cost, less profit
  - gets blamed


- the PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to
  treat your best customers

- you can buy a person's hand, but you can't buy his heart. His heart is where
  his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can't buy his
  brain. That's where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness.

>> No one can persuade another to change. Each of us guards a gate of change
>> that can only be opened from the inside. We cannot open the gate of another,
>> either by argument or by emotional appeal.


## Part Two: Private Victory

### Habit 1: be proactive -- principles of personal visio

- because of the unique human capacity of self-awareness, we can examine our
  paradigms to determine whether they are reality, or principle-based or if they
  are function of conditioning and conditions

##### the social mirror

- there are three social maps

1. genetic determinism (inherited)
2. psychic determinism (from childhood/parents)
3. environment determinism(boss, spouse, economy, politics)

- Nazi Captured Frankl. They controlled everything in his environment but not what was on his mind.
- he choose to imagine a future that he would like to have, he at least had that freedom

- between stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose

##### "proactivity" defined

- "response-ability" -- the ability to choose your response

- highly proactive people recognize that responsbility
  - they do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior
  - their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice(base on values),
    rather than a product of their conditions(based on feelings)

- in making such a choice, we become reactive
- reactive people are often affected by their physical environment
  - if the weather is good, they feel good, it affect their performance

- proactive people can carry their own wheather with them

- reactive people are also affected by their social environment (social whether)

- the ability to subordinate an impulse toa value is the essence of the proactive person

##### taking the initiative

- many people wait for something to happen or someone to take care of them

- people who end up with the good jobs are proactive ones who are solutions to
  problems, not problems themselves.


##### act or acted upon

>> what is our response? What are we going to do? How can we exercise initiative
>> in this situation?

##### listening to our language

- reactive language: there is nothing i can do. thats just the way i am. he
  makes me so mad. they wont allow that. i have to do that. i can't. i must.if only

- proactive language: lets look at our alternatives. i can choose a different
  approach. I control my own feelings. I can create an effective presentation. i
  will choose an appropriate response. choose. i prefer. i will. that language
  comes from a basic paradigm of determinism.

- a serios problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling
  prophecy. People become reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined,
  and they produce evidence to support the belief.

- weigh the consequences of each action, compare and choose what you want to do.  You don't "have to" it.

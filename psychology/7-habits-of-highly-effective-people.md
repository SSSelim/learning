# # 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

* on the maturity continuum:

- *dependence* is the paradigm of you. you take care of me; you come through for
  me, you didnt come through me, I blame you for the results

- *independence* is the paradigm of I. I can do it, I am responsible, I am
  self-reliant, I can choose

- *interdependence* is the paradigm of we. We can do it, we can cooperate, we
  can combine our talents and abilities and create smth greater together

- life is, by nature, highly interdependent. To try to achieve maximum
  effectiveness through independence is like trying to play tennis with a golf
  club, the tool is not suited to the reality


- true effectivesness is a function of two things:

1. what is produced (the golden eggs)
2. the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose)

- if you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the
  goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the
  other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden
  eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose.

- effectiveness lies in the balance: P/PC Balance
  - Production of desired result, the golden eggs
  - Production Capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs

#### organizational PC

- a machine, a responsible person
  - runs the machine in optimal, non-stop, no-maintaince
  - no-cost, high profit
  - gets promoted(golden egg)

- same machine(sick goose), another person gets in charge
  - machine starts to break down
  - high maintaince cost, less profit
  - gets blamed


- the PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to
  treat your best customers

- you can buy a person's hand, but you can't buy his heart. His heart is where
  his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can't buy his
  brain. That's where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness.

>> No one can persuade another to change. Each of us guards a gate of change
>> that can only be opened from the inside. We cannot open the gate of another,
>> either by argument or by emotional appeal.


## Part Two: Private Victory

### Habit 1: be proactive -- principles of personal visio

- because of the unique human capacity of self-awareness, we can examine our
  paradigms to determine whether they are reality, or principle-based or if they
  are function of conditioning and conditions

##### the social mirror

- there are three social maps

1. genetic determinism (inherited)
2. psychic determinism (from childhood/parents)
3. environment determinism(boss, spouse, economy, politics)

- Nazi Captured Frankl. They controlled everything in his environment but not what was on his mind.
- he choose to imagine a future that he would like to have, he at least had that freedom

- between stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose

##### "proactivity" defined

- "response-ability" -- the ability to choose your response

- highly proactive people recognize that responsbility
  - they do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior
  - their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice(base on values),
    rather than a product of their conditions(based on feelings)

- in making such a choice, we become reactive
- reactive people are often affected by their physical environment
  - if the weather is good, they feel good, it affect their performance

- proactive people can carry their own wheather with them

- reactive people are also affected by their social environment (social whether)

- the ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person

##### taking the initiative

- many people wait for something to happen or someone to take care of them

- people who end up with the good jobs are proactive ones who are solutions to
  problems, not problems themselves.


##### act or acted upon

>> what is our response? What are we going to do? How can we exercise initiative
>> in this situation?

##### listening to our language

- reactive language: there is nothing i can do. thats just the way i am. he
  makes me so mad. they wont allow that. i have to do that. i can't. i must.if only

- proactive language: lets look at our alternatives. i can choose a different
  approach. I control my own feelings. I can create an effective presentation. i
  will choose an appropriate response. choose. i prefer. i will. that language
  comes from a basic paradigm of determinism.

- a serios problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling
  prophecy. People become reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined,
  and they produce evidence to support the belief.

- weigh the consequences of each action, compare and choose what you want to do.  You don't "have to" it.


### Habit 2: begin with the end in mind

- imagine your own funaral, person from family, from friends, work, community
- what would you like each of these speakers to say about you and your life?

>> if the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just
>> gets us to the wrong place faster

* all things are created twice:

- there is a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation of all things

- Habit 1 says: "You are the creator."
- Habit 2 is the first creation

- leadership deals with the top line: what are the things I want to accomplish?

>> Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things.

- management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership
  determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

- the metamorphosis taking place in most every industry and profession demands
  leadership first and management second.

#### rescriptings: becoming your own first creator

- self-awareness, imagination, conscience

- conturies have their own written constituion, individuals could have their own

#### alternative centers

* security, guidance, wisdom, and power

- spouse centered
- family centered
- money centered
- work centered
- possesion centered
- pleasure centered
- friend/enemy centered
- church centered
- self centered

* spouse centeredness

- thread is strong emotional dependence, emotional worth
- become vulnerable to anything affecting the spouse
- phantom security when all appears to be going well
- guidance is based on the emotion of the moment
- wisdom and power are lost in the counterdependent negative interactions

* family centeredness

- sense of security or personal worth comes from family tradition/culture/reputation
- guided by the emotions of the moment


* money centeredness

- security comes from the net worth, many factors could affect this net worth
- work and money provide no wisdom, no guidance, only limited degree of power and money

- put aside everything else, economic demands come first
-

>> the work will come again, but childhood won't -- a father rejecting to work on saturday

* work centeredness

- workaholics, work comes before health, relationships and other areas
- work is their identity: i am a doctor, i am a writer, i am an actor
- self-worth is in their work, 
- security is vulnerable of act on their work
- guidance is a function of the demands of the work
- wisdom and power come in the limited areas of their work

* possession centeredness

- possession of metarial, and fame, glory etc
- it can vanish rapidly, influenced by so many forces
- security coming from there will always felt threatened
- feel superior with someone with less of them, or inferior with someone with much of them


* pleasure centeredness

- instant gratification is available and encouraged
- consumes so fast, next level of fun should be bigger and higher
- too many vacations, too many movies, too much tv, too much video, game playing
- where is security, the guidance, the wisdom, and the power?

* friend/enemy centeredness

- acceptance and belonging to a peer group
- making an enemy center of one's life, to the point of an obsession; a colleage, a boss, manager

- allowing one individual and his weaknesses to distort his entire map of life
- effecting one's relationship with other loved ones

- divorced coupled, still psychologically still married
- they each need the weaknesses of the former partner to justify their accusations

- has no intrinsic security
- feelings of self-worth are volatile, a function of emotional state or behavior of other people
- guidance comes from the person's perception of how others will respond
- wisdom is limited by the social lens or by an enemy-centered paranoia

- the individual has no power, other people are pulling the strings

* self centeredness

- if we look closely at many of the popular approaches to growth and
  self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core

- there is little security, guidance, wisdom, or power in the limited center of self

- it accepts but neves gives, becomes stagnant

#### identifying your center

- a center may be limiting your personal effectiveness

- more often than not, a person's center is some combination of these and/or other centers

- depending on time and condition, another center could become the compelling force

- goind from one to another, resulting relativism is like roller coasting through life

- there is no consistent sense of direction, no persistent wisdom, no steady
  power supply or sense of personal, intrinsic worth and identity

- the ideal is to create one clear center from which you consistently derive:
  - a high degree of security
  - guidance, wisdom, power
  - empowering your proactivity
  - giving congruency and harmony to every part of your life

#### a principle center

- our security comes from knowing that correct principles do not change

- we can depend on them, principles don't react to anything

- principles don't die

- they can not be destroyed

- the personal power that comes from Principle-Centered Living is the power of:
  - a self-aware
  - knowledgeable
  - proactive individual
  - unrestricted by
    - the attitudes, behavior, and actions of others
    - many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people



- personal responsibility, or proactivity, is fundamental to the first creation

- habit 1 says "you are the programmer"
- habit 2 says "write the program"

#### visualization and affirmation

- a good affirmation has five basic ingredients:
  - it is personal
  - it is positive
  - it is present tense
  - it is visual
  - it is emotional

- if you visualize the wrong thing, you will produce the wrong thing

- almost all of the world-class athletes and other peak performers are visualizers

- they see it; they feel it; they experience it before they actually do it

>> they begin with the end in mind

- affirmation and visualization are forms of programming

#### identifying roles and goals

- writing is a kind of psycho-neural muscular activity which helps bridge and
  integrate the conscious and subconscious minds

- writing distills, crystallizes, and clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts

- they may get consumed by work and neglect personal health

>> without involvement, there is no commitment

### Habit 3: put first things first -- principles of personal management

>> things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least

1. what one thing could you do(you arent doing now) that if you did on a regular
   basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life?

2. what one thing in your business or professional life would bring similar results?

- habit 3 is the personal fruit, the practical fulfillment of habits 1 and 2

- habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation

- right brain imagines, make plan as a leader, left brain manages/executes the plan

#### the power of independent will

- self-awareness, imagination, conscience, and independent will

- effective management is putting first things first

- leadership decides what "first things" are

>> the successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do

>> they dont like doing them either necessarily, but their disliking is
>> subordinated to the strength of their purpose

- subordination requires a purpose, a mission(habit 2)

- independent will, do something even when you don't want to do it

- be a function of your values rather than a function of the impulse or desire
  of any given moment

#### four generations of time management

- organize and execute around priorities

#### quanrant II

- urgent means it requires immediate attention

- urgent matters are usually visible, insist on action, right in front of, pleasent
- often these urgent things are unimportant

- importance, on the other hand, has to do with results
- if smth is important, it contributes to your mission, your values, your high priority goals

- quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management
- it deals with things that are not urgent, but are important
- all those things we know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren't urgent

#### what it takes to say "no"

- the only place to get time for Q2 in the beginning is from Q3 and Q4

- a Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center

#### the quadrant II tool

- a Quadrant II organizer will need to meet six important criteria:

1. coherance: suggests that there is harmony, unity, and integrity between:
  - your vision and mission
  - your roles and goals
  - your priorities and plans
  - your desires and discipline

2. balance: help you to keep balance between different areas of your life

3. Quadrant II focus: organize your life on a weekly basis

4. A "people" dimension: need a tool that deals with people, not just schedules

5. flexibility: your planning tool should be your servant, never your master

6. portability: should also be portable

#### living it

- habit 1: you are the programmer
- habit 2: write the program
- habit 3: run the program

#### deletegation: increasing P and PC

- if we delegate to time, we think efficiency
- if we delegate to other people, we think effectiveness

- the key to effective management is delegation

- there are basically two kids of delegation:

1. gofer delegation
  - go for this, go for that
  - do this, do that
  - tell me when it is done

2. stewardship delegation
  - focuses on results instead of methods
  - gives people a choice of method

- trust is the highest form of human motivation
- it brings out the very best in people

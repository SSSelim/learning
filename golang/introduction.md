# Solving Modern Programming Challenges with Go

- Developers have to make an uncomfortable choice between rapid development and
  performance when choosing a language

- C and C++ offer fast execution, whereas Ruby and Python offer rapid development

- Go offers a high-performance language with features that make development fast

- Go has a concise syntax with few keywords to memorize

- Go has a compiler that's so fast

- Go's built-in concurrency features will scale to use the resources available
  without forcing you to use special threading libraries

 - Go uses a simple and effective type system that takes much of the overhead
   out of OO development and lets you focus on the code reuse

- Go also has a garbage collector

- Go is modern, fast, and comes with a powerful standard library

- Go has concurrency built-in

- Go uses interfaces as the building blocks of code reuse

- No semi-colon required if not writing multiple statements in a line

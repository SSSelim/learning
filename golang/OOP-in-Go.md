# OOP in Go

- Although Go supports OOP, it provides neither classes nor inheritance

- Go support the creation of custom types

- Go makes aggregation (has-a) extremely easy

- Go also allows for the complete separation of a type's data from its behavior


*Duck Typing:*

- Go supports duck typing

- Duck typing is a powerful abstraction mechanism that means that values can be
  handled(passed to functions), based on the methods they provide, regardless of
  their actual types

- "If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it 'is' a duck"

# ASM

- started as phd project, open sourced in 2002

* Two ASM libraries

1. Event based (SAX like)

2. Object based (DOM like)


- You need to work with bytecode
- you could use javap to convert your java to bytecode for starting point

** Positives:
  - speed and size
  - documentation
  - depth of functionality
  - number of people using the framework

** Negatives:
  - developer ramp-up
  - writing byte code

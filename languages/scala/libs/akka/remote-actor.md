# Remote Actors

- Actor programming is not restricted to only a single JVM

- actors can communicate with each other across multiple JVMs

- are a great way to make the application scalable and distributed(scaling out)

- use protobuf for serialization and JBoss Netty for NIO (replaced with Actor IO?)

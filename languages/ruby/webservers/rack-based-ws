# A comparasion of Rack based Web Servers

## Rack
applications developed using Ruby can be exposed to the WWW through one of the many
available web servers. There is one thing in common these servers share:
a way (an interface) to talk with your application called 'Rack'.

A modular Ruby webserver interface

Rack is not only a specification but a middleware application as well.

Rack middleware, implementing the 'Rack specification', works by dividing incoming
HTTP requests into different pipelined stages and handles them in pieces
until it sends back a response coming from your web application(controller).

It has two distinct components: a Handler and an Adapter, used for communicating
with web servers and applications(frameworks) respectively.

## Web Servers

### Phusion Passenger: Fast web server & app server
Passenger is a little unique, In "standalone mode," it can act just like an app server.
But it can also be built right into a web server,
so there wont be need for a separate app server to run Rails apps.
This can be really convenient, especially if there are plans for running a bunch of apps
and dont want to spend time setting up an app server for each one.

Passenger today has become the recommended server for RoR applications.

Passenger provides the ability to work with 'multiple' applications hosted on the same server.

### Puma: A Modern, Concurrent Web Server for Ruby
Puma is a Rack exclusive Ruby web application serser.

Puma has quite a small foot print, both in size and execution resources comsumption.

### Thin: Tiny, Fast, & Funny HTTP Server
Thin is a very popular application server which claims itself to be the most
'secure, stable, fast and extensivle Ruby web server'.

Being an Event/Machine based application server, Thin is capable of handling long running
requests unlike some other choices without the help of a front facing reverse-proxy solution.

### Unicorn: Rack HTTP Server for Fast Clients and Unix
Unicors is a very mature web application server.

It is fully-featured, however, it denies by design trying to do everything.

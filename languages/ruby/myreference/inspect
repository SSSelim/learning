# the useful inspect method,
# which returns a string with a literal representation of the object it’s called on:

>> puts (1..5).to_a            # Put an array as a string.
1
2
3
4
5
>> puts (1..5).to_a.inspect    # Put a literal array.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> puts :name, :name.inspect
name
:name
>> puts "It worked!", "It worked!".inspect
It worked!
"It worked!"


# using inspect to print an object is common enough that there’s a shortcut for it, the p function:
>> p :name             # Same output as 'puts :name.inspect'
:name

# Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language.

# Rails is opinionated software.
  It makes the assumption that there is the "best" way to do things,
  and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives.
  If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity.
  If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development,
  and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.


# Don't Repeat Yourself:
  DRY is a principle of software development which states that 
  "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
  By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.

# Convention Over Configuration:
  Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application,
  and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.

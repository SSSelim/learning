embedded Ruby, also called ERb.
ERb is the primary template system for including dynamic content in web pages.


<% provide(:title, "Home") %>

<title><%= yield(:title) %> | Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App</title>

The distinction between the two types of embedded Ruby is
that <% ... %> executes the code inside,
while <%= ... %> executes it and inserts the result into the template.

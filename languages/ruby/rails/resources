A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people or animals.
You can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.

Rails provides a resources method which can be used to declare a standard REST resource.
You need to add the article resource to the config/routes.rb as follows:

Rails.application.routes.draw do
 
  resources :articles

  root 'welcome#index'
end

$ rake routes       # to check all standart RESTful actions

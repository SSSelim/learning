# Child Processes

- Node facilitates creation of child processes to leverage parallel processing
  on multi-core CPU based systems

- Three major ways to create a child process:
  1. exec  - method runs a command in a shell and buffers the output
  2. spawn - launches a new process with a given command
  3. fork  - a special case of spawn to create child processes

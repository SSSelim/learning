# AST Transformations

- changing the structure of the Groovy language

- several trick of Groovy magic come from the powerful meta-programming
  facilities offered during runtime that can change classes and methods in ways
  impossible with vanilla Java.

- Groovy also support compile-time macros (abstract syntax tree)

- by using AST transformations, a programmer can add/change several syntactic
  features of Groovy code, modifying the syntax in forms that were difficult or
  impossible in Java

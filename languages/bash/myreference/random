TEMP_FILE=$TEMP_DIR/printfile.$$.$RANDOM

The $TEMP_DIR variable contains either /tmp or ~/tmp depending on the availability of the directory.
It is common practice to embed the name of the program into the file name.
We have done that with the string "printfile".
Next, we use the $$ shell variable to embed the process id (pid) of the program.
This further helps identify what process is responsible for the file.
Surprisingly, the process id alone is not unpredictable enough to make the file safe,
so we add the $RANDOM shell variable to append a random number to the file name.
With this technique, we create a file name that is both easily identifiable and unpredictable.

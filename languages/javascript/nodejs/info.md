# Node

- It is a server-side platform built on Chrome's Javascript Engine V8
- Nodejs uses an event-driven, non-blocking IO model
- It is lightweight and efficient
- A good fit for data-intensive real-time apps that run across distributed
  devices

- Node.js = (Runtime Environment) + (Javascript Library)

## Features of Node.js

- Asynchronous and event driven
- Very fast(V8)
- Single threaded but highly scalable
- No buffering - never buffers any data, simply output the data in chunks

## Where to Use Node.js

- IO bound apps
- Data streaming apps
- Data intensive real-time apps(DIRT)
- JSON APIs based apps
- Single page apps

- It is not a best choice for CPU intensive apps
# V8 Engine

- Javascript, V8, node.js are are written in C++

- At the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine

- The V8 engine converts JS code into machine code

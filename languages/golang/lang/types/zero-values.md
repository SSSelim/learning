# Zero Value

- Go guarantees that when a value is created it is always initialized to its zero value

- Numbers are initialized to 0

- Strings are initialized to empty string

- Pointers are initialized to nil

- Fields inside structs are similary initialized

- There is no uninitialized data in Go

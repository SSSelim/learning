# Spock Framework

- Spock = JUnit + Mockito + JBehave(BDD) (union of existing Java testing libs)

- initially created in 2008 by Peter Niederwieser (inspired by jMock and RSpec)

- testing and specification framework

- BDD approach

- uses groovy as language (can test either Groovy or Java code)

- facilitate easy data driven testing

- meaningful reporting

- readable code

## Drawbacks

- need to learn groovy

- some extra setup required for maven

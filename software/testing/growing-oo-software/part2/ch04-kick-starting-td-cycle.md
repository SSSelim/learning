# ch04 - kick-starting the test-driven cycle

- starting with "build, deploy, and test" on a nonexistent system sounds odd, but it is essential
- the risks of leaving it to later are just too high

### first, test a walking skeleton

- a "walking skeleton" is an implementation of the thinnest possible slice of
  real functionality that we can automatically build, deploy, and test end-to-end

- whilst building the "walking skeleton" we concentrate on the structure and
  don't worry too much about cleaning up the test to be beautifully expressive

### build sources of feedback

- the ideal situation is where the team releases regularly to a real production
  system, this allows the system's stakeholders to respond to how well the
  system meets their needs, at the same time allowing us to judge its implementation

### expose uncertainty ealry

- projects with later integration start calmly but generally turn difficult
  towards the end as the team tries to pull the system together for the first time

- a well-run incremental development runs in the opposite direction

- it starts unsettled but then, after a few features have been implemented and
  the project automation has been built up, settles in to a routine

- a "walking skeleton" will flush out issues early in the project when there is
  still time, budget, and goodwill to address them

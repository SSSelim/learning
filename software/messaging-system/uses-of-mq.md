# Uses For MQ

- Decoupling

- Redundancy

- Scalability

- Resiliency(producer can continue even if consumer goes down)

- Delivery guarantees

- Ordering guarantees (FIFO)

- Buffering (consumer can be slow(image editing), that does not slow down producer(image uploading))

- Asynchronous communication

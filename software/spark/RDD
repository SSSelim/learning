- Spark's primary abstraction is a distributed collection of items called
  a Resillient Distributed Dataset(RDD).

- RDDs have actions, which return values.
  count()
  first()

- RDDs have transformation, which return pointers to new RDDs.
  filter()
  map()
  flatMap()
  reduceByKey()

- All transformations in Spark are lazy. They are only computed when an action 
  requires a result to be returned to the driver program.

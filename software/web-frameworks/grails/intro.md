# Getting started with Grails

- Grails is a Groovy-based rapid web application framework
- It utilizes several 3rd part libraries to implement its functionality
- (Hibernate, Spring, JUnit, Tomcat, and more)
- It is a full-stack web framework
- Grails borrows heavily from the Rails concept of 'convention over configuration'

# N-tier Architecture

- Enterprise applications follow the N-tier architecture model to handle
  numerous nonfunctional concerns such as upgradability, scalability, and
  maintainability.

- The best design approach is to decouple the tiers from each other; this allows
  scaling out a tier without affecting another tier, or refactoring code in one
  tier without affecting other tiers.

- Usually, web application contains three tiers; presentation, business logic,
  and database tier.

tr is an UNIX utility for translating, or deleting, or squeezing repeated characters.
It will read from STDIN and write to STDOUT.

echo "Hello" | tr "e" "E" # replace all e with E in given Hello string

echo "Hello how are you" | tr " " '-' # Spaces being transformed to hyphens

echo "Hello how are you 1234" | tr -d [0-9] # Digits (numerals) being deleted

tr "()" "[]"

tr -d [a-z] # delete all lower case from a to z

tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ # translate lower case to upper case

tr [:lower:] [:upper:] # translate lower case to upper case

tr a-z A-z

tr -s '\n' ' ' < file.txt # Join all the lines in a file into a single line

echo "This is for testing" | tr [:space:] '\t' # translate white spaces to tab

!! We can use -s option to squeeze the repetiton of characters.
echo "This    is    for testing" | tr -s [:space:] '\t'

tr -s " " " " # Replace all sequences of multiple spaces with just one space
!! echo "Hello world!" | tr "world" "name" # output : Heeea namee
Translate characters not strings!

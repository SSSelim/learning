Shell provides features for integer arithmetic.

(( expression )) 

to get the result start with $

(( e++ )) 
(( e-- )) 
(( e-=5 )) 

# Notice that whitespace is ignored:

echo $((2+2))
4
$ echo $(( 2+2 ))
4
$ echo $(( 2 + 2 ))
4

!! for floating point numbers use bc command
f=$(echo 1/3 | bc -l)

first_num=0
second_num=0

echo -n "Enter the first number --> "
read first_num
echo -n "Enter the second number -> "
read second_num

echo "first number + second number = $((first_num + second_num))"
echo "first number - second number = $((first_num - second_num))"
echo "first number * second number = $((first_num * second_num))"
echo "first number / second number = $((first_num / second_num))"
echo "first number % second number = $((first_num % second_num))"
echo "first number raised to the"
echo "power of the second number   = $((first_num ** second_num))"
       
# Notice how the leading "$" is not needed to reference variables inside the arithmetic expression such as "first_num + second_num".

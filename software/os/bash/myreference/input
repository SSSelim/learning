READ

To get input from the keyboard, you use the read command.
The read command takes input from the keyboard and assigns it to a variable.

Here is an example:

echo -n "Enter some text > "
read text
echo "You entered: $text"

If you don't give the read command the name of a variable to assign its input, 
it will use the environment variable REPLY.

The read command also takes some command line options. The two most interesting ones are -t and -s.
The -t option followed by a number of seconds provides an automatic timeout for the read command.
This means that the read command will give up after the specified number of seconds if no response has been received from the user.
This option could be used in the case of a script that must continue even if the user does not answer the prompts.

Here is the -t option in action:

echo -n "Hurry up and type something! > "
if read -t 3 response; then
  echo "Great, you made it in time!"
else
  echo "Sorry, you are too slow!"
fi

The -s option causes the user's typing not to be displayed.
This is useful when you are asking the user to type in a password or other confidential information.

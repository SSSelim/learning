The test command is used most often with the if command to perform true/false decisions.
The command is unusual in that it has two different syntactic forms:

# First form

test expression

# Second form

[ expression ]

if [ -f .bash_profile ]; then
  echo "You have a .bash_profile. Things are fine."
else
  echo "Yikes! You have no .bash_profile!"
fi

Here is a partial list of the conditions that test can evaluate.
Since test is a shell builtin, use "help test" to see a complete list.

-d file
        True if file is a directory.

-e file
        True if file exists.

-f file
        True if file exists and is a regular file.

-L file
        True if file is a symbolic link.

-r file
        True if file is a file readable by you.

-w file
        True if file is a file writable by you.

-x file
        True if file is a file executable by you.

file1 -nt file2
                True if file1 is newer than (according to modification time) file2

file1 -ot file2
                True if file1 is older than file2

-z string
          True if string is empty.

-n string
          True if string is not empty.

string1 = string2
                True if string1 equals string2.

string1 != string2
                True if string1 does not equal string2.

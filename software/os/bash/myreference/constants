There may be values that, once set, should never be changed.
These are called constants. It is a common idea in programming.
Most programming languages have special facilities to support values that are not allowed to change.
Bash also has these facilities but, to be honest, I never see it used.
Instead, if a value is intended to be a constant, it is given an uppercase name to remind the programmer 
that it should be considered a constant even if it's not being enforced.

Environment variables are usually considered constants since they are rarely changed.
Like constants, environment variables are given uppercase names by convention.
Uppercase names for constants and lowercase names for variables.

CONSTANT_VARIABLE="this value will not change!!"

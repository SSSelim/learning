Uniq command is helpful to remove or detect duplicate entries in a file.

The uniq command replaces the consecutive repetitions with only one line in each case.

uniq -c <filename> # to count occurrence of lines in file

uniq -d <filename> # only prints duplicate lines

uniq -u <filename> # only prints unique lines

uniq -c -i | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//' # trim leading and trailing white space.

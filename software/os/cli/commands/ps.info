Understanding what the processes running on our computers are doing is important.
Which processes are using the most memory? Which are using the most CPU?
These are important questions, along with how to find a particular process.

PID   The process ID of the process.
TTY1  The controlling terminal for the process.
TIME  The cumulative CPU time the process has used since the process started. The format for this time is [ dd-]hh:mm:ss.
CMD   The name of the command that is running

ps  # When the ps command is run without any arguments,
      it will return results for the processes that belong to the current user

ps u # display common useful information. user-oriented.

ps -e # display all processes. almost same as "ps ax"

ps -U root # display processes by user ID

ps -m -O %mem -u root # -m sort by memory usage. -O %mem usage memory field

ps -r -O %cpu -u root # -r sort by cpu usage. -O %mem cpu field

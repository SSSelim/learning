take several files and archive them together into a single file -
this is where the tar (tape archive) command comes in.

tar can quickly join together multiple files into one larger file,
while still preserving meta-data such as Unix permissions.
By default tar does not compress files,
but it does have a flag that will compress the archive using gzip.


tar -c <directory> # the archive was printed to STDOUT and not saved to a file.
                     Writing archives to the STDOUT instead of a file can be useful 
                     when you want to pipe the output of the archive into another command.
                     it is useful to know that tar can create an archive without having to save it to a file.


tar -cf foo.tar <directory> # save the archive to foo.tar. doesnt print any output.

tar -cvf foo.tar <directory> # print the list the files in the archive

tar -cvf foo.tar <file> <anotherfile> <directory> # as many as we want

find . name \*gemspec | tar -cvf gemspecs.tar -T - # find files. -T read file list from another file. - for pipe.

tar -tf foo.tar # list files in existing archive

tar -xvf foo.tar # extracting files 

tar -xvf foo.tar <filename> # just extract specified file

tar -rvf foo.tar <filetobeappened> # append additional files to the archive

tar -uvf foo.tar <filetobeupdated> # update file in archive

tar -xvf foo.tar -C ./newfolder # specified the location to be extracted to

tar does not compress archives by default,
it just generates a single large file from multiple smaller files.
tar does provide three different compression algorithms to you.
The first one, gzip (-z), is the most common.
The others are bzip2 (-j) and Unix compress (-Z).
bzip2 is considerably slower for compression and decompression, but produces smaller archives,
and Unix compress is faster, but produces considerably larger archives.

tar -czf foo.tar.gz <directory> # use the -z flag to run the archive through gzip and compress it to make it smaller.
                                 it is customary to append .gz to the end of the archiveâ€™s file name 
                                 to let others know that this archive has been compressed

tar -xvzf foo.tar.gz # extracting compressed files

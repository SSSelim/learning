# React Router Overview

- In a single-page app, everything is happening on the same page

- Features like browser history, bookmarks, and forward and back buttons will
  not work without routing solution

- 'Routing' is the process of defining endpoints for your client's requests
  
- The endpoints work in conjunction with the browser's location and history objects

- The endpoints are used to identify requested content so that JS can load and
  rneder the appropriate user interface

- React does not come with a standard router

- The React Router has been adopted by the community as a popular routing
  solution for React apps

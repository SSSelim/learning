# Events

- The interfaces presented by HTML web pages are 'asynchronous' and 'event-driven'

- Event listeners, also referred as event handler

- Events by the system
  - timers
  - completion of asynchronous request

- Events by user
  - click
  - entering text

- HTML itself handles the events:
  - clicking an anchor tag
  - submitting a form

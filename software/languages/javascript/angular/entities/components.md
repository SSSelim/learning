# components

- encapsulated element that maintains its own internal logic

- in HTML, a select element can be considered a component

- using Angular, we create our own html elements using components

- key principles for components:
  * encapsulation: keep component logic isolated
  * isolation: keep component internals hidden
  * reusability: allow component reuse with minimal effort
  * event-based: emit events during the lifecycle of the component
  * customizable: possible to style and extend the component
  * declarative: component used with simple declarative markup

# prefetching data

- prevents display of partial page
- reuses code
- improves flow when an error occurs (if detail does not exist, dont route)


## who fetches the data

- user click -> router routes -> partial page shown -> data is fetched by component -> shown on template

- user click -> router resolves data -> route -> show complete page


## route

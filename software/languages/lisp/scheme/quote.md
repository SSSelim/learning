# quote

- All tokens are ready to be evaluated
- A special form named 'quote' is used to protect tokens from evaluation

```shell
(+ 2 3)         ;evaluated to 5
(quote (+ 2 3)) ;gives back '(+ 2 3)' as it is
```

- It is frequently abbreviated as '
- () is empty list
- Normally () is evaluated to nothing
- '() gives empty list

# Variable in Python

- Everything in Python is an object.
  - Variables, functions, even code

- Every object has an ID, Type, Value
  - ID uniquely identifies a particular instance of an object
    - Cannot change for the life of the object

  - Type identifies the class of an object
    - Cannot change for the life of the object

  - Values is the contents of the object
    - Mutable objects can change value, immutable objects cannot

- All variables in Python are first class objects

- Most fundamental types in Python are immutable:
  - numbers, strings, tuples

- Mutable objects include:
  - lists, dictionaries, other objects depending upon implementation

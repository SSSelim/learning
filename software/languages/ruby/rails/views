# A view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format.
  An important distinction to make is that it is the controller, not the view, where information is collected.
  The view should just display that information.
  By default, view templates are written in a language called eRuby (Embedded Ruby)
  which is processed by the request cycle in Rails before being sent to the user.

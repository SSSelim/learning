# Everything is an object in Ruby.
print self # Ruby treats self as the object in which it is currently referred to.

# Each object in Ruby may have methods associated with it.

if # is for comments, then how come # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- works?
Ruby still ignores that as code, but it's used as a kind of "hack"
or workaround for problems with setting and detecting the format of a file.
You also find a similar kind of comment for editor settings.

If you are from another country, and you get errors about ASCII encodings, 
then put this at the top of your Ruby scripts:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

It will fix them so that you can use Unicode UTF-8 in your scripts without a problem.

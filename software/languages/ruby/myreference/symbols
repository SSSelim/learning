When you place a colon in front of a simple word, you get a Ruby symbol.
Symbols are much cheaper than strings (in terms of computer memory.) 
If you need to use a word over and over in your program itself, use a symbol.
Rather than having thousands of copies of that word in memory,
the computer will store a symbol only once, and refer to it over and over.

books["some book"] = :quite_good

puts "symbol".object_id == "symbol".object_id  # false
puts :symbol.object_id == :symbol.object_id    # true

As a result of having less baggage,
symbols are easier to compare to each other;
strings need to be compared character by character,
while symbols can be compared all in one go.
This makes them ideal for use as hash keys.

# Why manipulate bytecode?

- Program analysis
  - find bugs in code
  - examine code complexity

- Class generation
  - proxies
  - remove access to certain APIs
  - compiler for another language like Scala

- Transform classes without Java source code
  - profilers
  - optimization and obfuscation
  - additional logging

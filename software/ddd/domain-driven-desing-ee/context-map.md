# Context Map

- An individual BOUNDED CONTEXT still does not provide a global view. The
  context of other models may still be vague and in flux.

- Code reuse between BOUNDED CONTEXT is a hazard to be avoided.

- Integration of functionality and data must go through a translation.

Identify each model in play on the project and define its BOUNDED CONTEXT. This
includes implicit models of non-oo subsystems. Name each BOUNDEDN CONTEXT, and
make the names part of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE.

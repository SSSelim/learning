# Domain Model

- A domain model is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is
  intended to convey.

- It is not just the knowledge in a domain expert's head; it is a rigorously
  organized and selective abstraction of that knowledge.

- The model is distilled knowledge.

- The model is the team's agreed-upon way of structuring domain knowledge and
  distinguishing the elements of most interest.

- In the old waterfall method, the business experts talk to the analysts, and
  analysts digest and abstract and pass the result along to the programmers.
  This approach fails because it completely lacks feedback.

# Associations

- There are at least three ways of making associations more tractable:

1. Imposing a traversal direction

2. Adding a qualifier, effectively reducing multiplicity

3. Eliminating nonessential associations

- One direction of the association is much more meaningful and important than the other

- Constraining on association may make the many-to-many to one-to-many

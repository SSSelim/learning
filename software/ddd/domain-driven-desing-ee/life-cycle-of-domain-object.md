# Life Cycle of a Domain Object

- Some objects are basic, transient, created and garbage collected.

- Some other objects go through changes of state to which invariants apply.
  Managing these objects presents challenges that can easily derail an attempt
  at Model-Driven Design.

- The challenges fall into two categories:

1. Maintaining integrity throughout the life cycle

2. Preventing the model from getting swamped by the complexity of managing the life cycle

## Aggregates

## Factories

## Repositories

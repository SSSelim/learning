# SQL Notes

- One of the features of SQL is ability to control access to your tables
  by multiple users. Being able to grant or deny access to an entire db is
  sometimes simpler than having to control the permissions on each of multiple
  table

- SQL is case-insensitive.

- Capitalization and underscore help you program in SQL

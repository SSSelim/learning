# CRUD in MongoDB

- RDDBMS - Mongo  - SQL
- Create - Insert - Insert
- Read   - Find   - Select
- Update - Update - Update
- Delete - Remove - Delete

- MongoDB's CRUD operations exist as methods/functions in programming language
  APIs, not as a separate language.

- MongoDB does not have its own query language analogous to SQL.

- Instead, MongoDB has a wire protocol

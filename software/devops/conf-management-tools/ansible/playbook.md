# playbook

- instead of putting many ad-hoc commands in a script file, we can use playbooks
  - each ad-hoc would query the state and it will be not performant

### playbook.yml

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

- docker-cli -> docker-compose.yml
- ad-hoc -> playbook.yml

```shell
ap playbook.yml
```

# Problems that Devops Solves


## Organization Characteristics

- Complex pipeline
- teams with their own policies and procedures
- compliance policies, infrastucture acquisition policies
- leave after deployment: everything and everyone with project now gone
- shared, centralized IT organization that delivers services

## Organizational Pain

- painful outages
- project deployed, who knows about the project?
- spending too much and money, when is ready, is outdated

### Slow I.T.

- it's ops for not getting resources fast enough and waiting weeks to get
  servers and taking forever to deploy code that's been sitting ready to go for weeks

- information security who says no to everything new

### Infighting

- toxis culture of us vs them between the IT and some of the end users.

- IT Teams don't collaborate themselves and treating IT as separate from the
  business isn't good either.

- Development and Engineering who might be getting bonuses and incentives based
  on how much did they ship code and what kind of features can they get out
  there. So their motivation is to push as much as they can.

- Then you get the Ops theam who is incented by stability and high availability
  and they're motived to stop any deployments because they want to maintain
  something stable.

- You have infighting between different competing interests.

## Identifying Waste

- Knowledge waste: marketing, engineering do not share knowledge

- Scared of chaging exiting system because any of the core knowledge no longer exists

- Waiting waste: env to be created, code finish to test, waiting reports etc

- Over-production waste: ask more capacity than need so no to go back asking again

- Over-processing waste

- Motion waste: repeated tests

- Transportation waste: moving code, packages between environment

- Correction waste: is okay to have some defects

- Inventory waste: waiting for code to be shipped

## Devops

- Add value
- improve flow

* Lean
  - focus on customer value
  - eliminate waste
  - reduce cycle time
  - shared learning
  - avoid batching
  - theory of constraints (can go as fast as your bottleneck )

* Devops CAMS
  - Culture
  - Automation
  - Monitoring (can't measure, can't improve)
  - Sharing

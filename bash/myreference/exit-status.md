# Exit Status

- is an integer in the range of 0 to 255, indicates the success or failure of the commandâ€™s execution.

- By convention, a value of zero indicates success and any other value indicates failure.

- The shell provides a parameter that we can use to examine the exit status.

```shell
ls -d /usr/bin
#/usr/bin
echo $?
#0

ls -d /bin/usr
#ls: cannot access /bin/usr: No such file or directory
echo $?
#2
```

- The difference between a good program and a poor one is often measured in terms of the program's robustness.

- That is, the program's ability to handle situations in which something goes wrong.

```bash
# Example of a really bad idea
cd $some_directory
rm *

# check the exit status

cd $some_directory
if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
    rm *
else
  echo "Cannot change directory!" 1>&2
  exit 1
fi

# A better way

if cd $some_directory; then
    rm *
else
  echo "Could not change directory! Aborting." 1>&2
  exit 1
fi
```

## use error exit function. promotes laziness!


## true and false

- extremely simple builtin commands that do nothing except terminate with either a zero or one exit status.

- The true command always executes successfully and the false command always executes unsuccessfully:

```shell
true
echo $?
#0

false
echo $?
#1
```

## exit command

- we should set the exit status when our scripts finish. To do this, use the exit command.

- causes the script to terminate immediately and set the exit status to whatever value is given as an argument.

```bash
exit 0 # exits your script and sets the exit status to 0 (success)

exit 1 # exits your script and sets the exit status to 1 (failure).

exit $? # exits with the exit status of the last command before this
```

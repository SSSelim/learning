An alias allows a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.
The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the alias and unalias built-in commands.

$ alias # to see the alias in current shell

# define your alias in ~/.bash_aliases

alias la='l -a' # create an alias

unalias la      # remove an alias

!! Aliases are not inherited by child processes. Bourne shell (sh) does not recognize aliases.

!! Functions are faster !! 
Aliases are looked up after functions and thus resolving is slower.
While aliases are easier to understand, shell functions are preferred over aliases for almost every purpose.

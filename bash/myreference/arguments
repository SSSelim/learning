To handle options on the command line, we use a facility in the shell called positional parameters.
Positional parameters are a series of special variables ($0 through $9) that contain the contents of the command line.

[me@linuxbox me]$ some_program word1 word2 word3

If some_program were a bash shell script, we could read each item on the command line 
because the positional parameters contain the following:

$0 would contain "some_program"
$1 would contain "word1"
$2 would contain "word2"
$3 would contain "word3"

you will want to check to see if you have arguments on which to act.
There are a couple of ways to do this.
First, you could simply check to see if $1 contains anything like so:

if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
  echo "Positional parameter 1 contains something"
else
  echo "Positional parameter 1 is empty"
fi

Second, the shell maintains a variable called $# 
that contains the number of items on the command line 
in addition to the name of the command ($0).

if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then 
  echo "your command line contains $# arguments"
else
  echo "your command line contains no arguments"
fi

ENVIROMENT 

When you log on to the system, the bash program starts, and reads a series of configuration scripts called startup files.
These define the default environment shared by all users. This is followed by more startup files in your home directory that define your personal environment.
The exact sequence depends on the type of shell session being started.
There are two kinds: a login shell session and a non-login shell session.

A login shell session is one in which we are prompted for our user name and password; when we start a virtual console session, for example.

/etc/profile      A global configuration script that applies to all users.

~/.bash_profile   A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script.

~/.bash_login     If ~/.bash_profile is not found, bash attempts to read this script.

~/.profile        If neither ~/.bash_profile nor ~/.bash_login is found, bash attempts to read this file.
                  This is the default in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu.


A non-login shell session typically occurs when we launch a terminal session in the GUI.

/etc/bash.bashrc  A global configuration script that applies to all users.

~/.bashrc         A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script.

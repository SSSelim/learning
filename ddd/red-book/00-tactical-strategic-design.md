# Tactical and Strategic Design

## Tactical Design

- Sometimes DDD is first embraced as a technical tool set.

- Some refer to this approach to DDD as DDD-Lite.

- We may have homed in on Entities, Services, possibly made a brave attempt at
  designing Aggregates, and tried to manage their persistence using
  Repositories. Those patterns felt a bit like familiar ground, so we put them
  to use. We may even have found some use for VOs along the way.

- All of these fall within the catalog of tactical design patters, which are
  more technical.

## Strategic Desing

- the "other half" of DDD, the strategic design patterns

- If you have left out the use of Bounded Context and Context Maps, you have
  probably also missed out on the use of the Ubiquitous Language.

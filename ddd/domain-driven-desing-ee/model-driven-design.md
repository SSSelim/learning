# Model Driven Design

- Projects that have no domain model at all, but just write code to fulfill one
  function after another, gain a few advantages of knowledge crunching and
  communication. A complex domain will swamp them.

- On the other hand, many complex projects do attempt some sort of domain model,
  but they don't maintain a tight connection between the model and the code.

- If the design, or some central part of it, does not map to the domain model,
  that model is of a little value, and the correctness of the software is
  suspect. At the same time, complex mappings between models and design
  functions are difficult to understand and, in practise, impossible to maintain
  as the design changes. A deadly divide opens between analysis and design so
  that insight gained in each of those activities does not feed into the other.

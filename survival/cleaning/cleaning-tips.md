# cleaning tips

1. top to bottom, left to right

2. get all the stuff you need closer to yourself, dont go back and forth

3. let the product stay, give time to chemical to its job

4. eye level test, look at the stuff from eye level
  - under something lower than eye level
  - top of something above eye level

5. the "S" pattern
  - not circle, circle way takes the dirt and put it back
